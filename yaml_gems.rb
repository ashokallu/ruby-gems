gem 'yaml_extend' # Extends YAML to support file based inheritance
gem 'safe_yaml' # Parse YAML safely
gem 'yaml_vault' # yaml encryption/decryption helper.
gem 'yaml_normalizer' # Yaml Normalizer follows the notion that there is a normalized YAML file format. It re-formats YAML files in a way that the results closely match Psych's output. Yaml Normalizer ensures that the original file and the resulting file are 100% identical to Psych (stable change).
