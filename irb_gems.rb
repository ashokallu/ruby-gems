gem 'looksee' # Supercharged method introspection in IRB.
gem 'irbtools-more' # irbtools-more extend irbtools with some extra functionality which requires a compile step, like the amazing looksee gem. Put `require "irbtools/more"` in the .irbrc file in your home directory to load irbtools together with irbtools/more
gem 'irbtools' # The Irbtools make working with Ruby's IRB console more fun & productive.
gem 'fancy_irb' # A fancy IRB has a colorful input prompt and profiles rocket-style #=> return values
gem 'every_day_irb' # EveryDayIrb simplifies daily life in IRB with commands like: ls, cat, rq, rrq, ld, reset!, ...
gem 'wirble' # Handful of common Irb features, made easy.
gem 'hirb' # Hirb provides a mini view framework for console applications and uses it to improve ripl(irb)'s default inspect output. Given an object or array of objects, hirb renders a view based on the object's class and/or ancestry. Hirb offers reusable views in the form of helper classes. The two main helpers, Hirb::Helpers::Table and Hirb::Helpers::Tree, provide several options for generating ascii tables and trees. Using Hirb::Helpers::AutoTable, hirb has useful default views for at least ten popular database gems i.e. Rails' ActiveRecord::Base. Other than views, hirb offers a smart pager and a console menu. The smart pager only pages when the output exceeds the current screen size. The menu is used in conjunction with tables to offer two dimensional menus.
gem 'ripl' # ripl is a light shell that encourages common middleware for shells i.e. rack for ruby shells. It is also a modular alternative to irb. Like irb, it loads ~/.irbrc, has autocompletion and keeps history in ~/.irb_history. Unlike irb, it is highly customizable via plugins and supports commands i.e. ripl-play. This customizability makes it easy to build custom shells (i.e. for a gem or application) and complex shells (i.e. for the web). Works on ruby 1.8.7 and greater.
